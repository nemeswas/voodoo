 
Add or remove a servergroup. If no argument is given, a list
of the servergroup identifiers will be displayed including the
current one. If the identifier already exists it will make it
the currently active one. Servers that are added, are added to
the current servergroup. At startup the default servergroup
is "default". The "default" servergroup cannot be removed.
By setting the SERVERGROUP setting on a bot, that bot will only
connect to servers with that same SERVERGROUP. If a bot has no
SERVERGROUP setting, it will connect to any server regardless
of which servergroup the server belongs to.
