--- Alias support

  Command substitution

--- Async DNS support

  Normally energymech uses blocking calls to lookup hostnames.
On bad networks this could cause problems because the whole mech
process will lock up until it gets its answer from the domain name
server. Async DNS support, or RawDNS for short, uses low level code
to do hostname lookups asynchronously.

--- Botnet support

  Standard botnet functionality. Connect to other bots and share userlists
and other informaton. Partyline extends over the whole botnet.

--- Channel ban support

  Sometimes ypu want to keep people from certain other channels out of your
own channel. With channel ban enabled, the bot will periodically do WHOIS on
users in your channel and if they are in your rivals channel as well, they can
be kicked or banned, etc.

--- Command output redirect

  Certain commands like HELP normally require you to DCC chat or telnet to the
bot in order to execute. With command output redirect enabled, you can run
commands and force the output to be sent to a different target, like a nick,
channel or even file.

--- CTCP

  Standard CTCP replies, VERSION, PING and FINGER. CTCP is not necessary for
DCC chat and DCC file support to operate.

--- DCC file support

--- Debug support

  If you have a problem running a mech, debug output could explain whats going on.
Very necessary to include if you are a developer...
