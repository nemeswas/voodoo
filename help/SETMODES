Usage: SET MODES <value>
 
Number of MODE operations that can be sent to the IRC server
in a single line. This value can be auto-detected on server
connect if the bot is compiled with support for 005 replies
and the server sends them (most big networks today).

To support auto-detect of server capabilities, the energymech
needs to be compiled with the ircd-extensions feature enabled.
