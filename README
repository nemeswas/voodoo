Compiling?
~~~~~~~~~~
To compile the source:

1) git clone https://github.com/EnergyMech/energymech.git
-- If you don't have git you can still download the source:
    wget http://github.com/EnergyMech/energymech/archive/master.tar.gz
    tar xvf master.tar.gz

2) cd energymech
-- Since you are reading  this file,  you have most likely already
   come to this point.

3) ./configure
-- This script will prompt you for features to include or exclude,
   going with the default is not a bad idea.
-- If you want to cross compile export the prefix of your toolchain:
   export CROSS_COMPILE="armv7a-hardfloat-linux-gnueabi-"

4) make install
-- If you have a modern/more powerful machine you can try to compile
   the mech with  ``make mega'' or  ``make mega-install''.  This way
   produces a slightly more compact and efficient executable.
-- On a modern multi-core cpu, you can run make with the appropriate
   -j switch to shave off a few seconds of compile time.  (This will
   not work with ``make mega'' or ``mage mega-install''.
   For example:
     ``make -j4'' for a 4 core cpu system.

If  all  went  well  you  should  now  have  an executable  called
``energymech''.

Setup?
~~~~~~

Read the  sample.conf  file to  get  an idea of  the  config  file
commands and then try to make your own.  A basic setup doesnt need
much  more than NICK, SET ALTNICK, SET USERFILE,  JOIN and  SERVER
entries, the rest is mostly just tweaks of default values.

Quick steps:

1) cp sample.conf mech.conf

2) edit mech.conf
-- replace ''edit'' with your favourite text editor,  look through
   the file for sections to change,  you will have to remove lines
   in order to get the bot to work. Check the file completely!

3) make a userfile

   construct a temporary file (trick.conf) containing;
   ---------------------------------------------------------------
   set userfile whateveryouwanttonameit
   user + handle * *!*yourident@*.yourdomain.com 100 password
   save
   shutdown
   ---------------------------------------------------------------

   then 'run'  this file with  './energymech -f trick.conf'.  this
   will create a userfile  with the name  you chose ('mech.passwd'
   is a good descriptive name which I often use myself).

   re-use the filename  you selected in your  proper configuration
   file. and remember to 'rm -f mech.session' if you compiled your
   energymech with session support.

4) ./energymech

That should get you running. If you don't see your bot come on IRC
after a few minutes,  you should try running the bot in debug mode
to see what's going on with...

  ./energymech -d

If you get an 'Unknown option -d', you need to answer 'Y' to debug
support when running ./configure from the compiling section above.
Or run with ``./configure --with-debug''.

If you are unsure about if you configured everything correctly and
want to test the configuration, you can run:

  ./energymech -t

This will run the startup sequence in a normal way,  but will quit
right before the bot enters the main loop.
