 
Protection level can be 0 through 4 where the specific levels
are as follows:
 
  0   No protection.
  1   Reop/unban, do nothing to offender.
  2   Reop/unban, deop offender.
  3   Reop/unban, kick offender.
  4   Reop/unban, kickban offender.
 
The channel protection level limits the highest protection
level that will be enforced. For example, if channel protection
level is set to 2 and a user has protection level 4, that user
will still be treated as having only level 2 on that channel.
 
If channel protection level is set to 0 (zero), protection
will not be enforced at all.
