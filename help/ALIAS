 
Create or delete a command alias. Arguments like $1 will
be replaced with the corresponding argument from input.
 
$1     The first argument.
$1-2   The first and second argument.
$2-3   The second and third argument.
$1-    All arguments starting with the first.
$2-    All arguments starting with the second.
 
Example:
ALIAS MEEP SAY $2 $1 $3-
 
Would be translated in the following manner:
MEEP one two three four -> SAY two one three four
 
Aliases may call other aliases and aliases can be used
to replace built in commands. Aliases can recurse a
maximum of 20 times (prevents infinite loops).
