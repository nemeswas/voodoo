 
Kills all bots and exits. The mech will have to be restarted
manually hand if you want it to return. If a crontab entry
exists to keep the bot running, it will restart the bot once
cron runs it.
If a session file is in use, SHUTDOWN is the proper method
to kill the process. DIE will delete the killed bot(s) from
the session file.
