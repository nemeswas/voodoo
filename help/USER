Add/remove a host mask:

Only one channel or one mask can be modified with each USER command.
 
Prefix flags with a "-" to disable them or a "+" to enable them.

Bots can be added to the userlist to be recognized by other bots.
Use the special access level 200. No password is set for bots and is
not needed because level 200 users can not execute any commands.
They can not access bots by telnet either.
