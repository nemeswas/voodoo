 
Add or remove DNS servers from the internal list.
+ip to add a new host, -ip to remove an existing host.
Only IP's can be used, hostnames will not work
(the resolver cannot resolve itself). With no arguments
a list of the current known DNS resolver addresses are
shown, the next host to be used is marked with underline.
Use `dnsserver -0' to remove all known hosts.
