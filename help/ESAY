 
Works like SAY with some enhancements. As the bot parses the text
it replaces predefined variables with their current value:
  $access     Your own access on the current channel
  $cc         Current channel
  $channels   Channels
  $on         Ontime (same as ontime command)
  $time       Current time
  $var(x)     Show current setting for "x"
  $up         Uptime (same as uptime command)
  $ver        EnergyMech version
